    BehaviorAgent implements an agent that navigates scenes to reach a given
    target destination, by computing the shortest possible path to it.
    This agent can correctly follow traffic signs, speed limitations,
    traffic lights, while also taking into account nearby vehicles. Lane changing
    decisions can be taken by analyzing the surrounding environment such as tailgating avoidance.
    Adding to these are possible behaviors, the agent can also keep safety distance
    from a car in front of it by tracking the instantaneous time to collision
    and keeping it in a certain range. Finally, different sets of behaviors
    are encoded in the agent, from cautious to a more aggressive ones.
